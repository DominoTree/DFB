## David's Falcon Booster (DFB)

#### An attempt to build a low-cost memory expansion and accelerator board for the Atari Falcon.

The primary goals of the project are to:

* Be a plug-in board requiring no soldering on the Falcon;
* Increase available RAM beyond the 14MB the stock Falcon can be expanded to;
* Be low cost;
* Provide some acceleration;
* Allow the PSU to remain in the case;
* Be open source.

I'll be providing some development narration on this project's [Wiki](https://github.com/dh219/DFB/wiki) & an update on progress.

Firmware source, driver code and KiCAD files will be published at each release.
